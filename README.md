# This app displays the time in new york city 

### Even though I generally know the time difference between where I live and where I'm from — I still find myself googling something along the lines of "time in nyc". 

### The other day I accidentally ended up on time.nyc when I did this. The site was blank but I thought it shouldn't be — it should have probably have the time. time.nyc was too expensive so I went with thetime.nyc. Enjoy!
